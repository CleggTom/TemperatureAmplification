# Species interactions amplify the temperature dependence of microbial community respiration

This repository contains the code and data for the analysis in:

*Francisca C. García1†, Tom Clegg, Daniel Barrios O’Neill, Ruth Warfield, Samraat Pawar, Gabriel Yvon-Durocher* (2021) Species interactions amplify the temperature dependence of microbial community respiration.

files in the code directory used for analysis are:

• `Theory_simuliations.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing `julia` code to derive analyitical results and run simulations. To download required packages open julia, activate the environment in `TemperatureAmplification` by typing `]` and then `activate .`. Then, download the packages with `instantiate`

• `Theory_plotting.R `- R script used to plot theory results in fig 1.

• `ExperimentalRespirationFig2.R` - R script used to analyse respiration and plot fig 2.

• `Interaction_estimates.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing R code to analyse and plot interaction estimates and plot fig 3.

• `ExperimentalKSpsFigS1.R` - R script to analyse and plot species level K.

• `ExperimentalKComFig3bTable2.R` - R script to analyse and plot communtiy level K.
